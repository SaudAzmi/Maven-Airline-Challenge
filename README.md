About the dataset
We're looking at airline satisfaction scores for 129,880 passengers
Each record represents one passenger
Records contain details about passenger demographics, flight distance and delays, travel class and purpose, and ratings for factors like cleanliness, comfort, and service, as well as overall satisfaction with the airline
How to play the Maven Airlines Challenge
For this challenge, you'll be assuming the role of Senior Data Analyst for Maven Airlines, a US-based airline headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The latest passenger survey results just came in and it looks like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. The leadership team needs to take action fast, so they've brought you in to analyze the data and find the key areas to focus on for getting back on track.

Task is to recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Maven Airlines' satisfaction rate, and present it in the form of a single page report or dashboard.
